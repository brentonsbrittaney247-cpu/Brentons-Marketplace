# Android Production Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.production.local before building for Android

# Your production API URL (replace with your actual server URL)
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-production-server.com/api

# Socket.IO server URL
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://your-production-server.com

# For testing with a specific backend server during development:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://staging-server.com/api
# REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://staging-server.com

# Important Notes:
# - MUST use HTTPS in production (not HTTP)
# - Do not use 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' - Android can't access your local machine
# - If testing locally, use your computer's network IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
# - Ensure your server allows CORS from your app domain
